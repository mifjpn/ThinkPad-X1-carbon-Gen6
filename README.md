# ThinkPad-X1-carbon-Gen6-Hackintosh
## Overview
I was able to set the Platform to MacBookPro15,2, which seems to be the closest CPU.

The built-in camera is working, but the built-in microphone seems to be broken. (It may be because of second-hand goods)

I was able to confirm the operation with Ventura, but since Airportitlwm is unstable, itlwm and Heliport are included.
